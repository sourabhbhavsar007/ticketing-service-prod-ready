# ticketing-service-prod-ready


I managed to brainstorm and refine the ticketing service to make it prod ready and tried to add the missing pieces of code. For now, I've tried to add below features/enhancements:

1. Containerization : Firstly, we containerize our microservice using .dockerfile which I've added in the code. We can consider container orchestration using Kubernetes. Leveraging Kubernetes can also help in load balancing, horizontal scaling and also we can configure it for fault tolerance and auto-scaling.

2. Service Discovery (Eureka Server): We use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka, where your service can register itself and discover other services.

3.Profiling : Have tried to create profiling using application.properties.

4. Security Enhancements: Ensuring application supports HTTPS. SSL can be configured by adding certificates or by using reverse proxy for SSL termination. (Please refer pom.xml)

5. Spring Boot Actuator: For custom health checks, expose critical endpoints using /health, /info, /metrics

6. Circuit Breaker : Have added Resilience4j dependencies for circuit breaker pattern implementation.

7. Database Performance: Optimizing connection pool for HikariCP (refer application.properties)

8. Database Migration: Using Flyway for database migration

9. Prevent DDOS Attacks: To prevent DDoS attacks, we will implement rate limiting, IP blacklisting, and secure configurations. Have added Bucket4J dependency and used @RateLimiter

10. IP Filtering: IP-based filtering by adding a custom filter in Securityconfiguration.java

11. @Async: Can also be used if we have a suitable case for making it non-blocking and aync/reactive or Messaging Queues can be used.

12. Caching: We can use distributed cache like Redis or leverage Spring cache with @Cacheable

13. API Documentation: We can add OpenAPI (Swagger) dependencies for generating and publishing API docs.

14. Logging: We can use Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) for log trace or use correlation IDs for tracking individual requests across services when we have multiple microservices integrated/added in our system.

15. Follow 12-Factor App principles: For making app cloud-native.
  
16. CI/CD: Integrating CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab for automated testing, building and deploying service on different environments.
